# Bike Building

I have built this project to practise and demonstrate my understanding of OOP in Python. It is based on the idea of making, servicing, and repairing bikes.

## For the purposes of this project:

- Bikes are made up of multiple components. These components can be in different states and are not by default in a perfect state.

- Components have a current state and a maximum lifespan. The lifespan of each component is different and it is possible to check the current condition of the bike. 

- Components include: bell; brakes; chain; tyres; pedals. They are all types of components so they inherit the methods and attributes of the parent component class. Each component has a unique method that shows how each part is used and which decreases the current state of the component. A part cannot be used if it is broken.

- Riding a bike causes components to deteriorate and different types of bike will cause components to deteriorate at different rates. Each bike has at least four components and a way to use the methods on each component.

## Next steps:

- add in different types of bike, e.g. racing, BMX, mountain, city
